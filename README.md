# Cephalon

**Cephalon** is the infra-as-code repository for my home lab setup. Work in progress.

## Cluster installation

The cluster is based on [k3s](https://k3s.io/). This is a learning experience, so currently it is using a default installation with [k3sup](https://github.com/alexellis/k3sup) as the installer.
